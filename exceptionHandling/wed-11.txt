Exception Handling:


- Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors.


- Error which is thrown at run-time (which disturbs the normal flow of the program).


- two types * checked
		* unchecked
		* error(according to oracle)


- checked : The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException and Errors

		Are checked at compile-time.

		eg: IOException, SQLException etc.


- unchecked : The classes that inherit the RuntimeException.

		  Are not checked at compile-time, but checked at runtime.

		  eg: ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc.


- keywords to handle exception.

	* try : (Keyword) used to specify a block to write risky lines of exception within a method.

              we can't use try block alone.
		  
		  try block must be followed by either catch or finally.


	* catch : Used to handle the exception.

		    can use multiple catch block in single try block.

		    can't use catch block alone.

		    Then followed by finally block.
	
	* finally : Used to execute the necessary code of the program.
			
			To check whether an exception is handled or not.


	* throw : (keyword) used to throw an exception.

	
	* throws : (keyword) used to declare exceptions. 

		     occur an exception in the method.
